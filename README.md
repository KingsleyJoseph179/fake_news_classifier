# fake_news_classifier
A simple machine learning project, which classifies real or fake news using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TfidfVectorizer

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files: `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`, containing labeled news articles.

- `True.csv` – Real news articles
- `Fake.csv` – Fake news articles

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Combine and label data
3. Preprocess text using TF-IDF
4. Split data into training and test sets
5. Train a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Visualize results

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- Feature Extraction: TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## 📊 Results

*Include this after training the model*
- Accuracy: `xx.xx%`
- Precision / Recall / F1-score

## 📌 How to Run

```bash
python fake_news_classifier.py
